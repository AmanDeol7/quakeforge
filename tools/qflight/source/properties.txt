light/_light *
	halflife: "r g b i", r/g/b 0-255, i is id "light"
	rgb: "r g b"
	id: "intensity"
style *
	light style: 0-254
angle *
	spotlight cone angle in degrees. defaults to 20
wait
	light "falloff". defaults to 1.0
_lightradius
	size of light. interacts with falloff for distance clipping (?)
	defaults to 0
color/_color
	"r g b", r/g/b 0-1.0
_attenuation
	attenuation style:
		linear		id style. level falls off linearly from "light" at 0 to
					0 at distance "light".
		radius		similar to linear, but the cutoff distance is at "radius"
		inverse		1/r attenuation
		realistic	1/(r*r) (inverse-square) attenuation
		none		no attenuation, level is always "light"
		havoc		like realistic, but with a cutoff.
_radius
	the range of the light.
_noise
	noise intensity (?)
_noisetype
	noise type:
		random
		smooth
		perlin
_persistence
	noise parameter
_resolution
	noise parameter

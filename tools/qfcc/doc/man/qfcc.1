.SH NAME
qfcc \- The QuakeForge Code Compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qfcc
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqfcc\fP compiles GameC source into a form that the QuakeForge server can
understand.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
\fBqfcc\fP takes the following arguments:
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-source DIR
look for progs.src in DIR instead of the current directory.
.TP
.B \-q
Inhibit some of qfcc's normal output.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet LEVEL
Set quiet level to LEVEL. 1 is equivalent to \-q, 2 is silence.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-debug
Output symbol information for the QuakeForge server's built-in debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-code OPTION,...
Set code generation options. See
.B
CODE GENERATION OPTIONS
for details.
.TP
.B \-\-warn OPTION,...
Set warning options. See
.B
WARNING OPTIONS
for details.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show the version of qfcc.
.SH "CODE GENERATION OPTIONS"
The following options are valid for \fBqfcc\fP's
.B \-\-code
argument:
.TP
.B cow
Allow assignment to initialized globals. In QuakeC, a global that has been
initialized to a value is supposed to be treated like a named constant. However,
.B qcc
never really enforced this. The
.B cow
option allows
.B qfcc
to gracefully cope with QuakeC source that assigns values to
initialized globals in this manner. (also known as "copy on write" -- never mind
the bovine connotations)
.TP
.B v6only
Restrict the compiler to only version 6 progs (original Quake/QuakeWorld)
features. This means that the compiled data file should be able to run on older
servers, as long as you have not used any QuakeForge-specific built-in
functions. Also disables some of the compiler's features (like integers and
string manipulation support).
.SH "WARNING OPTIONS"
The following options are valid for \fBqfcc\fP's
.B \-\-warn
argument:
.TP
.B error
Promote warnings to errors. This works just like \fBgcc\fP's
.B -Werror
argument.
.TP
.B undef-functions
Emit a warning when a function is called, but has not yet been defined.
.TP
.B vararg-integer
Emit a warning when a function that takes a variable number of arguments is
passed a constant of an integer type.
.SH "FILES"
progs.src
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR quakeforge (1)
.SH AUTHORS
The original \fBqcc\fP program was written by Id Software, Inc. The members of
the QuakeForge Project have modified it to work with extensions to the QuakeC
language. To minimize confusion, the name of the language compiled by \fBqfcc\fP
is called GameC.

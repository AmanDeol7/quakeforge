/**
\mainpage QuakeForge
QuakeForge is a 3D graphics game engine based on id Software's legendary
Quake and QuakeWorld game engine.  Our purpose?  To improve the state of the
game by improving the engine and making it accessable to the largest number
of players we can.

While QuakeForge itself (and the Quake source code in general) is Free
Software, the game itself is not free. You need to either purchase it from <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/store/index.php?view=quake">id Software</a> or
you can use <a href="http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/">OpenQuartz</a>, a
project developing GPL compatable game data for Quake.

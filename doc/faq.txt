\section gfx_wad What does "W_LoadWadFile: unable to load gfx.wad" mean?
Q: I get the message "Fatal Error: W_LoadWadFile: unable to load gfx.wad" when
attpempting to one of the QuakeForge clients. What does it mean?

A: The most common cause of this error is QuakeForge is unable to find
pak0.pak. QuakeForge looks for pak0.pak in both the $fs_userpath/id1 and
$fs_sharepath/id1 directories. In Windows, both fs_userpath and fs_sharepath
default to "." (ie, the current directory: the same as id's quake clients). In
Linux (and other UNIX like operating systems), fs_userpath defaults to
~/.quakeforge and fs_sharepath defaults to $prefix/share/games/quakeforge
(distribution packages might alter the exact path).

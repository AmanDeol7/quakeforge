\section gfx_wad What does "W_LoadWadFile: unable to load gfx.wad" mean?
The most common cause of this error is QuakeForge is unable to find
pak0.pak. QuakeForge looks for pak0.pak in both the $fs_userpath/id1 and
$fs_sharepath/id1 directories. In Windows, both fs_userpath and fs_sharepath
default to "." (ie, the current directory: the same as id's quake clients). In
Linux (and other UNIX like operating systems), fs_userpath defaults to
~/.quakeforge and fs_sharepath defaults to $prefix/share/games/quakeforge
(distribution packages might alter the exact path).

\section pak0_pak Where can I get pak0.pak?
See \ref game_data

\section game_data Why doesn't QuakeForge come with the game data?
While QuakeForge itself (and the Quake source code in general) is Free
Software, the game itself is not free. You need to either purchase it from <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/store/index.php?view=quake">id Software</a> or
you can use <a href="http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/">OpenQuartz</a>, a
project developing GPL compatable game data for Quake.

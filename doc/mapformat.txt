A map consists of a series of entities delineated by {}

An entity consists of a series of either epairs or brushes, one per "line".

An epair is a pair of quoted (via "quotes") strings. The first string of the
pair is the key, the second string the value. epairs are used to populate the
dictionary of the entity.

A brush is a simple, convex polytope delinieated by {}. The format of a brush
is as follows:
\verbatim
{
[optional vertex list]
<plane spec> <texture name> <texcoord spec> [optional flags]
<plane spec> <texture name> <texcoord spec> [optional flags]
<plane spec> <texture name> <texcoord spec> [optional flags]
...
}
\endverbatim
That is, an optional vertex list followed by a number of surface specs, one
per line.

The optional vertex list, found in map files produced by Quest3d, is denoted
by a colon followed by a number indicating the number of vertices in the list.
Following this, one per line, come the 3d coordinates of the vertices, one
vertex per line. The vertex coordinates are listed in X Y Z order.

There are two formats for the plane spec, selected via the presence (vertex
mode) or absence (plane point mode) of the vertex list.

In vertex mode, the plane spec directly describes the shape of the surface
polygon. It is simply a number indicating the number of vertices, followed by a
set of 0 based indices, enclosed in (). The indices indicate which of the
vertices from the vertex list to use. When compiling the map, only the first 3
vertices are significant: they are used as the 3 points for calculating the
plane.

In point plane mode, the plane spec consists of three point vectors, each
enclosed in ().

The three points (from either mode) are then used to calculate the plane
normal and offset: n = (p0 - p1) x (p2 - p1), d = p1 . n

The texture name is just a simple string (no spaces) that specifies the name
of the texture within the wadfile.

The texcoord spec is black magic.

The optional flags indicate various options for the surface. So far, the only
flag supported is "detail", indicating that the brush is a detail brush and not
to be used for visibility calculations. If any surface has the detail flag set,
the whole brush is affected.

Example map file (vertex mode):
\verbinclude cliptest.map

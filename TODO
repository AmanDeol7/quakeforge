M  it seems possible to crash a QF server still - need to fix this!
M  Scitech MGL used in win32 is screwed - dump it and use SDL
I  GL is still way too slow
I  Client side QuakeC.
I  mingw cross compiling
I  merge nq and qw code bases
W  fix skybox/dome vis problems (workable solution found, needs new renderer)
o  ogg support
o  It's possible to stick on some obtuse-angled corners qwsv 2.3x didn't
o  better server control of certain cvars
o  triggers (f_respawn, f_death, f_took; cl_triggers)
o  software PCXs don't work in X11 at least if you're using 16/24/32 color
o  stateful console (eg, rcon mode, chat mode, normal command mode...)
o  menu rewrite
o  scripted hud
?  more direct intra-team comms (eg, talk to offense or defense directly)
?  Draw_Pic and friends need a cleanup in GL at least
?  console commands to see a user, ignore talk from them, etc
?  improved crosshairs (custom file, 32 bit for GL, etc)
?  software targets should mix color at 16/16 or 24/32 color
?  Draw_Pic and other tex draw functions should use local palettes
?  wad loader should load wad3 and fall back to wad2 if necessary
?  better control over client console logging
?  ban reasons and expire times
